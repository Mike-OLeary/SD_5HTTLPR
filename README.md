Regression_parser.v5.pl					* Perl script to read in QCed returned results files and return ~1200 .csv input files with keys for specific analyses to be read in by rmeta_script.4.r *

rmeta_caller.pl						* Perl script to read in processed results files and call rmeta_script.4.r to generate all possible meta-analysis forest plots and heterogeneity measures, ordered to run highest priority meta-analyses first.  Filter constant ("$beta_filter") currently set to exclude studies with extreme magnitude linear regression coefficients (magnitude >= ~9.9).  Full run of all meta-analyses took ~40 days *

rmeta_script.4.r					* R script to generate forest plots from intermediate hashes generated by rmeta_caller.pl with appropriate titles, axis labels, etc... *

title_forestplot.R					* R function modification for forestplot() to allow insert of tailored titles and other formatting changes *
